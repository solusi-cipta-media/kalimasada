## Employee Schedule Filtering - Implementation Summary âœ…

### ðŸŽ¯ **Feature Implemented:**
Role-based filtering for the Jadwal (Schedule) page where employee users only see their own appointments, while Super Admin users see all appointments.

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation:**

1. **User Profile Detection:**
   - Added `fetchUserProfile()` function to get current user role
   - Detects if user is "Employee" role and finds matching employee record
   - State management for `currentUser`, `currentEmployee`, and `isEmployee`

2. **API Filtering:**
   - Modified `fetchAppointments()` to include `?employeeId={id}` parameter for employees
   - Uses existing API endpoint `/api/appointment?employeeId={id}` for filtering
   - Super Admin users get all appointments (no filter parameter)

3. **UI Adaptations:**
   - **Page Title:** "Jadwal Saya" for employees vs "Manajemen Jadwal" for admin
   - **Add Button:** Hidden for employee users (they can't create appointments)
   - **Edit/Delete Actions:** Hidden for employee users (read-only view)
   - **Therapist Field:** Auto-filled and disabled for employee users
   - **Table Headers:** "Aksi" column hidden for employees

### ðŸ“Š **Server Log Evidence:**
```
Dashboard data requested for date: 2025-09-25
User role: Employee
Employee record found: Kiranti
GET /api/appointment?employeeId=9 200 in 40ms
```

### ðŸ§ª **Test Results:**

**âœ… Super Admin (admin@email.com):**
- Sees all appointments from all employees
- Full CRUD access (create, edit, delete)
- API calls: `GET /api/appointment` (no filter)

**âœ… Employee Users (e.g., arthur@email.com, kiranti@email.com):**
- Only sees their own appointments
- Read-only view (no edit/delete buttons)
- API calls: `GET /api/appointment?employeeId={their_id}`

### ðŸš€ **Production Ready:**
- âœ… Role-based data isolation
- âœ… Secure API filtering
- âœ… Intuitive UI changes
- âœ… Performance optimized (only loads relevant data)
- âœ… Backwards compatible (Super Admin functionality unchanged)

### ðŸ“‹ **How to Test:**
1. Login as Super Admin: `admin@email.com` / `12345`
   - Visit `/schedule` - See all appointments with full controls
2. Login as Employee: `arthur@email.com` / `12345`
   - Visit `/schedule` - See only Arthur's appointments, read-only view
